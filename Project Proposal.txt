Electronic Plant Sensor

Thomas Kokholm (tkok@itu.dk)

-Background & Motivation- (Jeg tror det er smart at lave dem som et afsnit)
For years students and other individuals have failed to keep plants alive, correct watering and sunlight is difficult to provide
in todays busy world. Yet we do desire to keep plants for their decoration as well as their oxygen production. A similar problem
is when is it necessary to vaccum, we do not wish to waste time by doing it too often, but still want our home to be clean,
today the typical solution is to make it a weekly tradition, but depending on how much you are at home and what you do, this is
far from an optimal solution. Our solution solves all these issues for the busy people of today, along with a huge range of
information about the temperature and other things in your home. Keep your home healthy.

Project Proposal Outline
You project proposal outline should (at least) contain the following things:

Basic information: Title, group members, email addresses, etc. (do NOT, however, add your birth date or CPR no.)
Background and Motivation, including core references
Main Problem or Idea
Suggested Solution described e.g. as a Scenario
Plan
Requirements for equipment, space, etc.
Supervisor
Project proposals should — just like the final project report  – follow the ACM Ubicomp Template for papers and notes.
We recommend using LaTex as your word processor.
